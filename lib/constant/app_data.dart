      "I started my career into software developement as android developer in 2018. I enrolled for an internship where I learnt about programming in general, learnt and built first android applications in native android, the internship lasted for 6 months. after that i continued building and exploring on my own, until Later in 2020 I heard about flutter which helps in building cross platform applications. After researching about flutter, I applied for an internship and got to learn and work for a full year, through which I was able to learn communication skills and code architectures and built a shopping clothing app together with my team for the comapny at the end of the internship. After that I worked as a freelancer for various persons and company until now, I gained experience of how to build applications in production level. I also learnt web basis like HTML, CSS and Javascript along the way. Presently I'm focusing on backend developement. I learnt how to create API using spring boot, And working ProjectModels on it. I'm currently learning SQL and postgreSQL.";
